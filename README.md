# KnockoutXMLNavMenu
*Simple navigation menu based on XML hierarchical structure using w3.css

This project is a template I use to create static content websites that need 
an intuitative  navigation menu.

The menu is built with 4 libraries/technologies:-
1. W3 CSS - A No script CSS library
2. Knocout JS - A data binding MVVM JavaScript library
3. jQuery - an all singing/dancing utility library
4. XML - Data format structure for the menu system

## W3 CSS
The W3 Schools website offer a simple responsive CSS system a an alternative
to some of the more well advertised CSS frameworks (e.g. Bootstrap)

You can link this directly at:-

## Knockout JS
Knockout is a web client side MVVM pattern library. Read about it here:-

## jQuery
jQuery does not really need me to introduce it! It is used here to download and interrogate an XML
data document describing the menu structure

## XML
Again, this does no need an introduction. I only mention it because almost every project these days utilises JSON for transmitting this type of information, but I still use it from direct queries of an MS SQL Serever.
