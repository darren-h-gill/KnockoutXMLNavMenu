        Section 2 is loaded dynamically  after processing the normal DOM.
    </p>
    <p>The reasoning behind this approach is to allow the main document to load quickly without
    worryig about a large chunk of data that is largely unnecessary and instead lets you focus on getting the content actually required!</p>
