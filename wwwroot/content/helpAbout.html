    <p>This site is a simple demonstrator of the navControl utility library.

    <p>It&apos;s main purpose is to show the generation of the menu at the top 
    with a secondary purpose of showing the method to dynamically load content into the page using the client hash tag anchors.</p>
    <p>Finally, it shows the lightbox popup from the W£ Schools w3.css framework.</p>
